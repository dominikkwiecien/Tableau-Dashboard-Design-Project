# Data Visualization and Dashboard Design Project

## Overview

This project showcases the importance of adhering to fundamental principles in data visualization and dashboard design. It is a practical demonstration of how these principles can be applied to create effective, insightful, and user-friendly analytical dashboards using Tableau.

## Project Objectives

The primary goal of this project is to demonstrate how crucial it is for a data analyst to follow best practices in dashboard design. By doing so, we ensure that the dashboards not only convey the right insights but also do so in a manner that is intuitive and accessible to users.

## Task Description

The project involves refining two dashboards that were previously created in Tableau, by applying key visual design principles. The dashboards are designed to help users quickly find answers to critical business questions and to present data in a clear and visually appealing manner.

### Key Principles Applied:

1. **5-Second Rule**:
   - Each dashboard is designed to answer 3-5 key business questions.
   - Users should be able to find an answer to at least one of these questions within 5 seconds of viewing the dashboard.

2. **Highlight Important Information**:
   - Critical metrics and KPIs are positioned in prominent areas, such as the top-left corner or the first row of the dashboard.
   - This ensures that users immediately focus on the most important data.

3. **Labeling and Annotation**:
   - All metrics are clearly labeled, and units of measurement are specified where applicable.
   - Numbers are rounded when appropriate to avoid clutter.
   - The dashboards are designed to avoid overloading users with excessive numbers and values.

4. **Consistent Color Scheme**:
   - A cohesive color scheme is applied throughout each dashboard.
   - Each section and metric has a unique color, all within a unified palette.
   - No more than two accent colors are used to ensure contrast and highlight key information.

## Dashboard Highlights

### 1. **Revenue Analysis Dashboard**
   - **Total Monthly Cash Inflows**: A line chart showing the trend of monthly revenue over time, allowing users to quickly identify periods of growth and decline.
   - **Total Revenue by Location**: A bar chart breaking down total revenue by geographic region (APAC, EMEA, USA), providing insights into regional performance.
   - **ARPPU & Paid Users Count**: A combination of bar and line charts displaying the average revenue per paid user (ARPPU) alongside the count of paid users each month.
   - **Revenue Cohort Analysis**: A table illustrating revenue evolution across different cohorts, helping users understand customer retention and revenue patterns over time.

### 2. **MRR and User Growth Dashboard**
   - **New MRR Over Time**: A line chart depicting the growth of Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR) across different months, segmented by the first purchase date of customers.
   - **Revenue and User Segmentation**: A dual-axis line chart showing the fixed total revenue and the percentage difference over time, offering a comprehensive view of revenue trends in relation to user segmentation.

## How to Use

Additionally, the Tableau workbook file (.twb or .twbx) will be included in this repository, allowing you to explore the dashboards offline or customize them further.

## Conclusion

This project exemplifies the application of visual design principles in creating analytical dashboards that are not only functional but also visually compelling. By following these best practices, the dashboards provide immediate, actionable insights, enhancing the decision-making process for business stakeholders.
